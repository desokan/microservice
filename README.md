# Blog Microservices Project with Docker, Kubernetes, GCP and GitHub Actions
This is a blog microservices project with Node JS, React and MongoDB. The services will run with Docker and I will be using Kubernetes for orchestrating the different services. I will also be leveraging Google Cloud environment for the development. Finally, I will use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
